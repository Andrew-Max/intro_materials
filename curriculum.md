#Curriculum

##Command line
  Being comfortable in the command line is essential to programming because many coding tools frameworks can only be run through the command line.

  You should be able to change between directories, view the contents of a directory, install packages and enter commands with root privileges. Each program you use on the command line will have its ows set of commands which will start with the name of the program.

  For example, once I have rails installed I can do various command line commands like

  "rails new [project name]" to create a new project

   or

  "rails server" to start a server for a rails project
