##Command line

###Notes
  - The language you use in the linux or mac command line is call Bash. The terminals of both OS's are based off of Unix. Windows uses a totally different command line language which sucks. It is a big reason why a lot of windows programming sucks
  ### command cheat sheat
  1. cd: change directory 
  2. pwd: list path of current directory
  3. ls: list contents of current directory
  4. . : reference for current directory
  5. .. : reference for parent of current directory (ie "cd .." will move you back one directory)
  6. ~ : reference for home directory (ie "cd ~" will move you to your home directory)
  7. / : reference for root directory
  8. sudo [command]: putting this in front of a command will cause that command to be administered with root (admin) priveleges. 
  9. sudo apt-get install [program] : the way you download programs through the command line in ubuntu
  10. sudo homebrew [program]: the way you download programs
